#### Welcome to a new phase of Red Planet!

<img width="512" height="512" alt="leg" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3104506-6f17-4d68-9005-8dc74e649af4" />

> ***$LEG** is a community-driven mem-token with no guaranteed returns. Please refer to the **Risk & Volatility** section for details.*

***“For true Legends who need new limbs.”***

**$LEG** is the Red Planet’s meme token, integrating the game economy, rewards, staking, and value circulation within the entire Red Planet ecosystem. It’s more than just an asset — it’s the **Red Planet’s circulatory system**, powering all products, missions, and ventures — from NFTs and DAO mechanics to RWAs and gaming activities.

### Why Legs?

> *The Red Planet is a hostile environment. Every expedition, every mission, and every step into the unknown requires sacrifice.

On the surface of the Red Planet, adventurers regularly lose limbs — not only physically, but also metaphorically. Mistakes, volatility, bad trades, market crashes, and shattered expectations leave their mark. Survival is not that of those who haven’t fallen, but of those who have managed to rebuild themselves.

This is how “legs” emerged as a symbol.
A leg represents the ability to continue on.

$LEG became a game form of this idea.
It’s about recovery, adaptation, and moving forward no matter what. Lose — restore. Spent — earn. Burn — become stronger.

In the Red Planet ecosystem, “legs” are a resource for survival, progress, and status. The more limbs you managed to save and collect, the further you’ve progressed.
Not everyone becomes a Legend.
But every Legend once lost a leg — and moved on.*

### I. Main idea

$LEG is more than just a meme token. $LEG is a **LEGEND Token** and simultaneously a “leg” — a symbolic element of survival on the Red Planet.

In the hostile Web3 environment, adventurers lose limbs, assemble prosthetics, exchange parts, and continue their journey. $LEG has become a memetic reflection of this philosophy: **to survive is to become a Legend**.

As Purt would say:

> *“If you’re not losing limbs in the blockchain, you’re not in Web3 at all!”*

No one survives on the Red Planet without losses, and $LEG is a way to **get back on your feet**.

**Where is $LEG used?**

$LEG serves as a universal gaming resource for the Red Planet ecosystem:

- iternal currency for the [Harvester bot](https://github.com/rpdao/Harvester/blob/main/README.md) and in-game activities;  
- reward for staking key NFTs ([Red Planet](https://www.stargaze.zone/l/stars1vk8fmh259xr4yz9qqh4x3xfrck80nvl9fu6d9gcaqjksx94xc6nqxzea0t), [Purt the Adventurer](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1peea6sz2qh34w5c9x8dmde89ykkaxwgt7e9kg7dnh2hvd2mtptcqswa9xq/tokens));  
- reward for staking the [$LEG token](https://app.osmosis.zone/assets/factory/osmo1c3sjhsneuajqn4ke84kqqaf26ct5cjs8z5ale0yv7096wh6fyf6qxmgkph/leg) itself;  
- reward for activities and campaigns on the [Centrifuge](https://centrifuge.digital/redplanetdao) platform;  
- a means of circulating value between Red Planet products;  
- an element of the “gray market for spare parts” — a memetic metaphor for the exchange of limbs between adventurers on the Red Planet who lost their legs during expeditions.

**Future utilities**

- mission contributions — $LEG donations to unlock quests, events, and DAO activities;  
- legendary ranking — a leaderboard of the “richest on their feet” adventurers;  
- burning $LEG in exchange for NFTs, access, and special rewards.

**Why is $LEG important?**

At the heart of any ecosystem are people, not tokens or protocols. Real people. Stubborn people. People with a sense of humor. People willing to move forward, even if they have to pick themselves up again.

$LEG is Red Planet’s social layer. A meme, a reward, and a participation mechanism all rolled into one. It captures contributions, humor, activity, and time spent on the Red Planet.

$LEG is about you. About our brotherhood. About how we transform the chaos of Web3 into a living, breathing economy.

### II. $LEG meme token

> *Game mechanics + liquidity + meme power = a tool for growth and engagement.*

**Initial liquidity**

Pair: **[$LEG / $OSMO](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/3248)**
Initial ratio: **1,000,000 $LEG = 1,000 $OSMO**

**The purpose of launching the pool**

Create an observable “volatility meme volcano” and engage the community in the process of “leg trading” as a game and economic mechanic.

**Pool replenishment mechanics**

- token buyback by the Red Planet DAO project;  
- buyback by active members;  
- replenishment from revenues from other ecosystem products (including Red Planet RWA mining).

**The meaning of the pool**

The $LEG pool is an indicator of the Red Planet’s “limb health”. The more active the community, the more vibrant the leg market. The more events, missions, and staking, the higher the circulation and value of $LEG.

**Ways to get $LEG**

- game activities in the Red Planet [Telegram chat](https://t.me/rpdao);  
- [$LEG token](https://app.osmosis.zone/assets/factory/osmo1c3sjhsneuajqn4ke84kqqaf26ct5cjs8z5ale0yv7096wh6fyf6qxmgkph/leg) [staking](https://daodao.zone/dao/osmo1qwryxetzf4ff4cacfz86f7whk7syn0zdjxrxkuhs7wa02aw3lfdqchqme6);  
- [Red Planet](https://www.stargaze.zone/l/stars1vk8fmh259xr4yz9qqh4x3xfrck80nvl9fu6d9gcaqjksx94xc6nqxzea0t) NFT [staking](https://daodao.zone/dao/stars140yxm2tkr0ncywwledtgsfmpvch3lg5mtafwm647s60hc3lrml8qashfah/home);  
- [Purt the Adventurer](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1peea6sz2qh34w5c9x8dmde89ykkaxwgt7e9kg7dnh2hvd2mtptcqswa9xq/tokens) NFT [staking](https://daodao.zone/dao/stars16nku9ysdxeedq709xtl0xz53ppyd3d4h9jn9rp2vs2vt8cpkxuwq06heh5/home);  
- [MiAmigos](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1lxl4hrx2cfl0qujl0xyz0jtlzftn3y84rzyn3jgshfznjmvfplzs6pplac/tokens) NFT holding;  
- twitter activity and community events;  
- [Centrifuge](https://centrifuge.digital/redplanetdao) missions and campaigns;  
- [DEX](https://app.osmosis.zone/assets/factory/osmo1c3sjhsneuajqn4ke84kqqaf26ct5cjs8z5ale0yv7096wh6fyf6qxmgkph/leg) purchases for participation or speculation.

**Retention and growth mechanics**

- $LEG staking is “accumulating legs” and participating in ecosystem development;  
- additional rewards for long-term holding;  
- boosts for holding staked NFTs;  
- participation in “legendary events” (entry through token burns, giveaways, and fairs);  
- burning = value. Each event reduces the circulating supply and increases scarcity.

**Meme component**

- “Legs at the Market.” “Limb Trade.” “Buy a New Leg — Become a Legend.”  
- $LEG’s aesthetic is built around the absurd yet recognizable realism of Red Planet: a gray market for parts, Red Planet prosthetics, leg factories, and adventurers who reassemble themselves after each mission.  
- Memes fuel the Red Planet economy.
